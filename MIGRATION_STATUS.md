Run the updated SQL schema in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Add new fields to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS links JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS interests TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';
```

### 2. Test Authentication Flow

2. Click "Log in" and create an account with a @gmail.com email
3. Check your email for verification link
4. Complete profile creation wizard
5. Test upvoting and viewing profiles

### 3. Verify Database Operations
Check your Supabase dashboard to confirm:
- ✅ New users appear in auth.users
- ✅ Profiles auto-created in profiles table
- ✅ Upvotes recorded in upvotes table
- ✅ Views incrementing on profiles/projects
- ✅ Projects created under user accounts

### 4. Monitor Performance
- Check Supabase dashboard for query performance
- Monitor RLS policy execution
- Review index usage

## 📝 Important Notes

### Field Name Changes
localStorage → Supabase mappings:
- `displayName` → `display_name`
- `id` → `user_id` (for profile references)
- `votes` → `upvotes`
- `bannerUrl` → `banner_url`
- Social links flattened: `social.x` → `social_x`
- Goal fields: `goal.title` → `goal_title`

### Function Signature Changes
- Most functions now `async` and return Promises
- View/upvote functions require `userId` parameter
- Delete project only needs `projectId` (RLS handles auth)

### Component Updates Required
When adding new features, use:
- `getCurrentUserProfile()` instead of `getCurrentUser()`
- `getUserProfile(userId)` instead of localStorage lookups
- `await` on all Supabase operations
- Check for null values from database queries
